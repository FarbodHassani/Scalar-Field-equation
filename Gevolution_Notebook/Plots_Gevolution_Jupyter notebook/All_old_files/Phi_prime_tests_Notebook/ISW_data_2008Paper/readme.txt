Power spectra of phi_dot, the time derivative of the potential measured from simulations run in a flat LCDM cosmology with Omega_m=0.25 and sigma_8=0.9
first column: k [h/Mpc]
second column, (\Delta_k)^2 [as shown in Fig. 1 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.4488.pdf]

file names give information about redshifts, e.g. "PSphiL1Z0.00_12" means z=0.00, and "PSphiL1Z15.0_1" means z=15.0
You need to combine files of the same name under the two diretories (dataBeta and dataBetaL8) to get the full range of k as shown in the figure.
